          <p>Hi my name is Mary Lee, the creator of the webpage.<br>
           Here are a few things about me. I live and was born in NYC. I was born on March 23, 2006.<br>
           That means that I am currently 10 years old. I learned how to code in HTML/CSS<br>
           at a place called Nano Hackers, which is a great place for young coders.<br>
           I obviously have an interest in coding and I love doing art.<br>
           That is all, so hope you like my webpage and enjoy!!</p>
