<b><u><h2>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening<h2><u><b>
  <h5>by Robert Frost<h5>
<i><p>Whose woods these are I think I know.<br>
  His is house is in the village, though;<br>
  He will not see me stopping here<br>
  To watch his woods fill up with snow.<br></p></i>

  <i><p>My little horse must think it queer<br>
  To stop without a farmhouse near.<br>
  Between the woods and frozen lake<br>
  The darkest evening of the year.<br</p></i>

  <i><p>He gives his harness bells a shake<br>
  To ask if there is some mistake.<br>
  The only other sound's the sweep<br>
  Of easy wind and downy flake.<br></p></i>


  The woods are lovely, dark, and deep,<br>
  But I have promises to keep.<br>
  And miles to go before I sleep.<br>
  And miles to go before I sleep.<br></p></i>
